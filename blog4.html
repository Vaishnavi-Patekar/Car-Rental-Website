    <b>What documents are required for car rental in India?</b>

    <ul>
        <li>Valid Driver’s License: You must have a valid driver’s license issued by the government of your home country or an International Driving Permit (IDP). An IDP is recommended if your license is not in English, as it serves as a translation of your license.</li>
        <li>Identity Proof: A government-issued identity proof, such as a passport or Aadhar card (for Indian residents), is usually required for verification purposes.</li>
        <li>Address Proof: Providing an address proof, such as a utility bill or rental agreement, is standard practice to confirm your residential address.</li>
        <li>Age Proof: You must meet the minimum age requirement to rent a car in India (usually 18 to 21 years, depending on the rental company). An age proof document like a passport or birth certificate may be necessary.</li>
        <li>Credit Card or Debit Card: Car rental companies often ask for a credit card (with sufficient credit limit) in the primary driver’s name for security deposit purposes. Some companies may accept a debit card, but it’s advisable to confirm this beforehand.</li>
        <li>International Travelers: If you are a foreign traveler, you will need a valid passport with an appropriate visa to enter India. Additionally, you may be asked to provide a return ticket to your home country.</li>
        <li>Driving History and Records: Some rental companies may ask for your driving history, especially if you are renting a premium or luxury vehicle.</li>
        <li>Travel Itinerary: For tourists, having a travel itinerary, hotel reservations, or details of your trip in India may be helpful during the rental process.</li>
        <li>International Credit Card Authorization Form: In some cases, if you are using an international credit card, the rental company may ask you to fill out an authorization form allowing them to charge the rental fees to your card.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s essential to verify the specific document requirements with the rental company in advance, as they may have additional policies or variations based on their location and business practices. Additionally, ensure that your driver’s license is valid throughout your intended stay in India and comply with local traffic rules and regulations while driving.</p>
